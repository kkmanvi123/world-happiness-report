        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The World Happiness Report, collected by partnerships of Gallup, 
            Oxford Wellbeing Research Center, Un Sustainable Development Solutions
             Network and the WHRs Editorial Board reflect on the worldwide demand 
             for more attention to happiness and the relation to government policy. 
             The Report reviews the state of happiness in the world today and explores 
             the science of happiness and provides explanations to personal and national 
             variations in happiness. This topic is highly important on an international level 
             with the UN attention within development goals, specifically Resolution 65/309 “Happiness: 
             Towards a holistic approach to development” which was adopted by the General Assembly of the 
             United Nations on July 19th 2011.</p>

        <p>This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between logged GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy based on 
          data from the World Happiness Report. The x-axis represents the logged GDP per capita values, while the y-axis shows 
          the healthy life expectancy in years. Each blue dot on the plot represents a country or region, with its position 
          determined by its corresponding logged GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy values. The overall pattern 
          suggests a positive correlation between the two variables, meaning that countries with higher GDP per capita tend 
          to have higher healthy life expectancy. However, the data points are scattered, indicating that the relationship is 
          not perfectly linear. There is considerable variation, with some countries deviating from the general trend. For 
          instance, some countries with relatively lower GDP per capita have surprisingly high healthy life expectancy, 
          while others with higher GDP per capita have lower healthy life expectancy than expected. The plot also includes a 
          ladder score legend on the right side, representing happiness or well-being as measured by the World Happiness Report. 
          This additional information could provide further context for interpreting the relationship between economic prosperity 
          and health outcomes across different countries or regions. Overall, this scatter plot effectively visualizes the 
          general positive correlation between GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy while also highlighting the variations 
          and potential outliers in the data.</p>

        <iframe src="heatmap_with_text.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
        <p>Above is a correlation heatmap from the World Happiness Report, showing the relationships between 
          various factors and their impact on happiness or life satisfaction. The heatmap uses different shades of blue 
          to represent the strength and direction of the correlations between the factors. Darker shades indicate stronger 
          positive correlations, while lighter shades indicate weaker or negative correlations. One key takeaway from the 
          heatmap is the strong positive correlation between healthy life expectancy, logged GDP per capita, and overall 
          happiness or life satisfaction. Countries with higher GDP per capita and longer healthy life expectancy tend to have 
          higher levels of reported happiness or life satisfaction. Another notable observation is the negative correlation 
          between perceptions of corruption and happiness or life satisfaction. Countries with higher perceived levels of 
          corruption tend to have lower levels of reported happiness or life satisfaction. Additionally, the heatmap shows 
          that factors like freedom to make life choices, generosity, and social support are positively correlated with 
          happiness or life satisfaction. Promoting personal freedoms, fostering a culture of generosity, and strengthening 
          social support networks can contribute to improved well-being and life satisfaction. Overall, the correlation heatmap 
          provides valuable insights into the interplay between various socioeconomic, health, and societal factors and their 
          influence on subjective well-being and happiness across different countries or regions.</p>

        <p>This radar chart compares various regions on multiple indicators related to happiness and well-being from the World 
          Happiness Report. The regions are represented along the radial axes, while the different metrics are depicted using 
          colored markers. The colored markers, as per the legend, correspond to indicators like ladder score, logged GDP per 
          capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of 
          corruption. For each region, the distance from the center to the marker indicates the score or value for that specific 
          indicator. Regions with markers closer to the outer edge perform better on those metrics, while those closer to the center 
          have lower scores. By examining the shapes formed by connecting the markers for each region, one can visually assess 
          the relative strengths and weaknesses across different factors contributing to happiness. For instance, Western Europe 
          scores highly on aspects like healthy life expectancy, GDP per capita, and social support but relatively lower on 
          perceptions of corruption. Conversely, Sub-Saharan Africa has lower scores across most indicators compared to other 
          regions. This radar chart effectively condenses a multitude of data points into an easily interpretable visual format, 
          enabling quick comparisons of regional performance on various happiness indicators. It highlights areas where targeted 
          interventions may be required to improve overall well-being in different parts of the world.</p>

        <p>This is an interactive visualization that displays geographical data related to the World Happiness Report. The 
          visualization allows users to select and view different indicators or factors that contribute to overall happiness 
          and well-being across countries and regions. These interactive maps enable users to explore and compare different 
          factors that influence happiness across the globe. By selecting different indicators from the dropdown menu, users 
          can gain insights into how factors like GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and 
          perceptions of corruption vary among countries and regions. For example, when the selected indicator is "Social 
          Support," the map is colored in shades, with darker shades representing higher levels of social support. North 
          America and Western Europe appear to have the highest levels of social support, while regions like Africa and parts 
          of Asia have lower levels. When you select "Ladder score," you can see that Western Europe, North America, Australia, 
          and New Zealand exhibit the highest ladder scores, indicating higher levels of happiness or well-being. In contrast, 
          several countries in Africa and parts of Asia have lower ladder scores. This type of interactive visualization is 
          valuable for understanding the multidimensional nature of happiness and well-being. It allows users to identify 
          patterns, hotspots, and potential areas of concern, which can inform policymaking and targeted interventions to 
          improve the overall quality of life for people around the world.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <!-- Add your overall data visualization here -->
        
        <p>Our analysis of the World Happiness Report 2021 data has uncovered insightful findings regarding the factors that contribute to happiness and well-being globally. We observed a positive correlation between economic prosperity, as indicated by GDP per capita, and better health outcomes, reflected in higher healthy life expectancies. This correlation suggests that countries with stronger economies often experience improved overall well-being. Additionally, our analysis highlighted the significant influence of social and governance factors on happiness levels. Regions such as Western Europe exhibited strengths in social support systems and economic indicators, while also facing challenges related to perceptions of corruption. Conversely, regions like Sub-Saharan Africa showed lower GDP per capita and social support levels, indicating areas needing targeted interventions to enhance well-being. Our key learnings underscored the interconnectedness of these factors and emphasized the importance of holistic approaches to policymaking and interventions.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, these findings have practical implications for policymakers, researchers, and communities. Policymakers can use these insights to formulate evidence-based policies that promote economic growth alongside robust social support systems, personal freedoms, and transparent governance. Targeted interventions tailored to specific regional strengths and weaknesses can lead to more effective improvements in well-being outcomes. Longitudinal studies and ongoing data analysis are crucial for tracking progress, identifying trends, and assessing the impact of interventions over time. Community engagement and stakeholder involvement are essential in fostering awareness, advocacy, and collaborative efforts toward creating environments that support happiness and quality of life for all. By leveraging these insights and taking proactive actions, we can work towards a more equitable and fulfilling future for individuals and communities worldwide.</p>
